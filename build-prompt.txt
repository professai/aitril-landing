Design and build a stunning static landing page for AiTril - a multi-LLM orchestration CLI tool that coordinates OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google Gemini in parallel.

## Design Requirements

### Aesthetic Guidelines (Critical - Avoid AI Slop)
You tend to converge toward generic, "on distribution" outputs. In frontend design, this creates what users call the "AI slop" aesthetic. Avoid this: make creative, distinctive frontends that surprise and delight. Focus on:

**Typography:** Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics.

**Color & Theme:** Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes. Draw from IDE themes and cultural aesthetics for inspiration.

Use the **60-30-10 rule** based on DNA emoji (🧬) colors:
- 60% dominant: Deep blue/purple (#4A5FD9 or similar rich blue-violet)
- 30% secondary: Complementary pink/magenta (#E94C89 or vibrant pink)
- 10% accent: Bright cyan/electric blue (#00D9FF for CTAs and highlights)

**Motion:** Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions.

**Backgrounds:** Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Layer CSS gradients, use geometric patterns, or add contextual effects that match the overall aesthetic.

**Avoid generic AI-generated aesthetics:**
- Overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts)
- Clichéd color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds)
- Predictable layouts and component patterns
- Cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character

### Content Requirements
- Hero section with compelling headline about multi-LLM orchestration
- Feature highlights: Parallel Queries, Agent Coordination (consensus/debate/code building), Session Management
- Code example showing tri-lam mode
- Installation instructions
- Link to GitHub (https://github.com/professai/aitril)
- Link to PyPI (https://pypi.org/project/aitril/)
- DNA emoji (🧬) as the visual identifier/favicon reference

### Technical Requirements
Create THREE separate files:
1. **index.html** - Semantic HTML5, minimal inline styles
2. **style.css** - All styles with CSS variables, animations, gradients
3. **app.js** - Minimal JavaScript for interactions (scroll effects, code copy button, etc.)

Use modern CSS features:
- CSS Grid and Flexbox
- CSS custom properties (variables)
- CSS animations and transitions
- No external dependencies (no Bootstrap, Tailwind, etc.)
- No framework libraries (vanilla JS only)

Make it:
- Responsive (mobile-first)
- Fast loading
- Visually striking and memorable
- Professional yet creative
- GitHub Pages ready

Think outside the box! Create something that feels genuinely designed for a cutting-edge multi-AI coordination tool. Make it feel like the future of AI collaboration.
