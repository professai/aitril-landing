  Implementation
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[OPENAI]:
To implement the AItril landing page based on the synthesized consensus, we'll create a project using Next.js, incorporating responsive design with Tailwind CSS, and include thorough testing. Here's a detailed plan along with the code, comments, and setup instructions:

### Project Setup and Initial Configuration

1. **Initialize the Project:**
   - Create a new Next.js project using the following command:
     ```bash
     npx create-next-app aitril-landing
     cd aitril-landing
     ```

2. **Set Up Tailwind CSS:**
   - Install Tailwind CSS and its peer dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
     npx tailwindcss init -p
     ```

   - Configure `tailwind.config.js` to include all files in the project:
     ```javascript
     // tailwind.config.js
     module.exports = {
       content: [
         "./pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
         "./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
       ],
       theme: {
         extend: {},
       },
       plugin...
